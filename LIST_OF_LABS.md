# List of labs

## C and memory management

The [C and memory management lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/C-Lab-Starter) introduces the use of arrays (and strings) in C, along with the allocation and freeing of memory. It uses [the CMockery test library](https://code.google.com/p/cmockery/) for unit testing, and `valgrind` to identify memory leaks.

## C system calls; traversing directories

The [Traversing Directories lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/Traversing-Directories-starter) introduces making system calls from C, with a focus on calls that allow one to traverse directories and examine the status of files. It (currently) uses shell testing tools and doesn't need any special tools, although `valgrind` can be used to identify memory leaks.

## Circuit design

The [Circuit Design lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/Circuit-design-lab) is a simple, ungraded, "in lab" experience with basic circuit design using the [Logisim program](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html) for the design work.
